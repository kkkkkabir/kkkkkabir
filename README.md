  <strong>:wave:I am Kabir Jain, a student learning Computer Science from Symbiosis Institute of Computer Studies and Research. I am a technology enthusiast who just loves to explore about smartphones, computers, and even weird tech. From an early age, I was very curious about how computers worked and how my favourite games were made; I really thought that some magic was involved in all of this. Fortunately, I discovered this magic, the magic that is programming! This field is so diverse and gives you so much freedom to work on whatever you want! As Richard Stallman said, "Programming is not a science. Programming is a craft", its true to this day and its true for me to excel in this craft and move ahead :computer:</strong>
